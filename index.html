				<p style="word-wrap: break-word;">
					I am a Nigerian web developer with science background. I love to spend my free time watching sports (tennis and football precisely), soliloquizing and scrolling through social media pages. I have studied computer science and have always been interested in web development, hence the will to turn this fantasy into a career. 
				</p>

				<p style="text-align: justify;">
					I'm highly energetic and motivated and I love to work as a member or a leader of a team. I am not a talkative but i am sociable and also focused on detailed work like programming and basically just getting the job done.
